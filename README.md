These projects support the GoGoGo module of the Contextual Electronics course.

The MotorDrive is a circuit board design that supports a brushed DC motor driver.

The EncoderBoard is a circuit board design that supports an optical motor encoder suitable for use with an encoder wheel (see below).

The EncoderWheel is the design for an encoder wheel that will fit the Sparkfun Shadow chasis (ROB-13301) and a Sparkfun 140 RPM hobby gearmotor (ROB-13302).
