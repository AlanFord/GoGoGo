# Encoder Wheel Design Notes

The basic design was created in Fusion 360.  The DXF file was created by making a new sketch from the surface of the part and exporting the sketch as a DXF file.

The .rd and .rld files are generated by importing the DXF file into RDWorksV8 for a Boss laser cutter.  Note that the final laser part was cut from 2mm clear acrylic using a kerf, or "sew width" of 0.28 mm.
